## Overview
This is an end to end Machine Learning Flight Fare Prediction Project developed and implemented using Flask web app and deployed on the Cloud Platform Heroku.

## Data Collection
The data used in this project was collected from the Kaggle website. It is an opensource data science community developed mainly for people who are interested to work in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning etc.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.
